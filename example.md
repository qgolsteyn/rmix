# An example document 

 As cringe-worthy it is to look at these videos in hindsight, I am particularly proud of the work our small team of volunteers made in 2016 to promote all the events happening in the engineering community at UBC. 

 With a team of three volunteers, we produced one video a week promoting different events on campus. It was an amazing opportunity for everyone to practice video production on a tigh timeline. I was also one of the main presenters on these videos, showcasing my lovely French accent to the whole community. 

 1. We succesfully showed the world how to do stuff 
 1. We didn't die 
 1. We didn't mess up 
 
 Let's try to do better next time!
